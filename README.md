# 📧 Email Spam and Phishing Detection using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect spam and phishing emails using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with NLP techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization. Built as part of a deep learning course project, it demonstrates model training, evaluation, explainability, and integration into a Streamlit-based UI.
